# Mini-Sprint: Learning Python with Minecraft

It is not always easy to get started using Python with Minecraft on a PC. Moreover, the use of this game as tool to teach programming can be a real challenge. This mini-sprint has as main goal to gather best practices in order to learn python by using Minecraft. The group level will be kids from secondary school.

The sprint will be given using a Spigot Minecraft server with a RaspberryJuice api. Participants do not need to be minecraft experts but they need to have Minecraft client installed.

Activities:

 * Setup environment: All participants need to be able to connect to the server and run python scripts. Other plugins could be tested.

 * Coding: Kids learn by doing, so the idea is to build something (for instance a castle) and in the process explain the fundamental of programming (variables, if-statements, loops, functions, etc). We are not going to do a draft of a book instead we are going to do a draft of a kind of Lego manual.

  This sprint seeks to contribute with open source material in order to bring python to a game that kids are passionate about.
